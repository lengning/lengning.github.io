EBSeq provides improved power and well-controlled FDR in isoform analysis by accounting for varying uncertainty across different isoform groups. It accommodates\r\nexperiments with two or more conditions. EBSeq graphical user interface and Galaxy wrapper are also available on EBSeq page.\r\n\r\n[EBSeq page](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kendzior/EBSEQ/)\r\n[EBSeq on GitHub](https://github.com/lengning/EBSeq)\r\n\r\n### EBSeqHMM\r\nEBSeqHMM is an R package for detecting expression changes in RNA-seq experiments with ordered conditions (e.g. time or spatial course). EBSeqHMM incorporates a hidden markov component to accommodate dependence between adjacent time points (positions).\r\n \r\n[EBSeqHMM page](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kendzior/EBSEQHMM/)\r\n\r\n[EBSeqHMM on GitHub](https://github.com/lengning/EBSeqHMM)\r\n\r\n### OEFinder\r\n\r\n### Oscope\r\n[Oscope page](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kendzior/OSCOPE/)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
